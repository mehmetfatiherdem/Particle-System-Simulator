## Introduction
Welcome to the 3D Particle System Simulator! This project aims to provide a realistic, interactive, and user-friendly platform for generating and manipulating 3D particle effects. Designed to fill the gap in the market for robust 3D particle simulators, our simulator supports various particle effects such as snow, fire, fireworks, and hyperspeed, making it an excellent tool for both novice and professional users in the computer graphics industry.

## Features
- **Realistic 3D Particle Effects**: Create diverse particle effects including snow, fire, fireworks, and hyperspeed.
- **Save and Load System**: Easily save and load your particle system configurations.
- **Skybox Control**: Enable or disable the skybox to suit your visual needs.
- **Particle System Editor**: An intuitive editor for creating and customizing particle systems.
- **Real-Time Texture Alteration**: Modify particle textures in real-time.
- **Dynamic User Interface**: A user-friendly interface to control particle properties, textures, colors, and emitter settings.
- **BÉZIER Curve Force Control**: Utilize BÉZIER curves to fine-tune forces over the particle's lifetime.
